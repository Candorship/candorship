# Candorship

 Chart the course. Share the journey.

 Candorship transforms how teams work together by putting transparency at the core of project management. See everything, know everything, achieve everything.

Run projects transparently in your organization by breaking down silos that interfere with team collaboration.

Candorship is a replacement for Basecamp, Jira, Trello, and similar products.
